# Type-safe DotEnv

Type-safe `.env` file is just a `.env` but Typed.

Types are enforced via a comment, so it is still a "vanilla" `.env`.

Type-safe `.env` file can be used with unsafe `.env` parsers, legacy parsers will ignore the comment.

Keys must be a non-empty ASCII string `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`, keys are validated. Key-Value separator must be `=`.

Parses the same `.env` file from the vanilla implementation tests.

Several orders of magnitude faster than the vanilla implementation. Implementation is ~ 50 lines of code.

Example:

```ini
# This is a comment
DB_HOST=localhost  # string
DB_USER=root       # string
DB_PASS="123"      # string
DB_TIMEOUT=42      # int
DELAY=3.14         # float
ACTIVE=true        # bool
```

# Uninstall

- Delete it.


# Dependencies

- It does NOT depend on `pip` (Not a `pip` wrapper), it can work with `pip` completely broken.


# Requisites

- Python 64Bit.


# FAQ

- How to use a Private PYPI custom URL ?.

Compile adding the argument ` -d:pypiApiUrl="http://url-here.io" `.

- This requires Cython ?.

No.

- This is a drop-in replacement of X ?.

No.

- Whats "Generate Fake Git Commits" ?.

Sometimes you may need to create commits to restart CI, trigger GitHub Actions, Git Hooks, etc
but you dont have anything new to commit, that feature can create empty commits to force-trigger the Git service.

Some Git services do not trigger for new repos with 1 or 2 commits,
that feature can create empty commits to force-start the Git service.


# Python Bugs

From XML-RPC API Server-side this endpoints wont work anymore (Not my Bug):

- `release_downloads`, `top_packages`, `updated_releases`, `changed_packages`.
- Sometimes PYPI returns Python Tracebacks as strings on the body of the response.
- We tried to implement fully parallel install of packages, but because of the way Python packages work, they need to be installed sequentially whatsoever.

Quote from PIPEnv Project:

> pipenv release cadence came to a super dramatic halt because of a lot of upstream issues
> (pip broke, setuptools broke, then pip and setuptools both released breaking fixes,
> and we have about 15 dependencies which I personally maintain).

Quote from PIP Project:

> Due to lack of interest and maintenance, 'pip bundle' and support for installing files is now deprecated.

Important, near year 2021, the PyPI server started responding empty responses and error messages,
but with HTTP status 200 OK, to PIP alternatives that are not the official PIP, the error message said
`HTTPTooManyRequests: The action could not be performed because there were too many requests by the client. Limit may reset in 1 seconds.`
and your client has to wait >1 second per request, even for empty responses, and sometimes retries fail anyway,
this looks kinda intentional, maybe to make it look like PIP is the fastest or something like that ?.

All Python tools dropped support for Python `2.7` and `3.5`, some only support `3.8` as of ~2021.

As of 2021 PYPI says that the Search API of XML RPC is now "permanently disabled"

PIP breaks after upgrades https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5599
